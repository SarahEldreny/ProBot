to procurement data. The assistant should be able to interact with users, retrieve information
from the dataset, and provide relevant answers to their inquiries.
Dataset:
The dataset provided contains information on large purchases made by the State of California.
You must use this dataset to train your model and build the chatting assistant. You can

# Task Description:

1. Data Exploration:

● Load the dataset into MongoDB as a database management system.

● Explore the dataset to understand its structure, features, and contents.


2. Model Development:

● Implement Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to enable
conversational interactions.

● Develop algorithms to parse user queries and extract relevant information.

● Train the model using the dataset to enable it to understand procurement-related
queries.


3. Chatting Assistant Features:

● Design a conversational interface allowing users to ask questions about
procurement data.

● Implement functionalities to handle various types of queries, such as:

● Total orders created during a specific period (e.g., month,
quarter).

● Identification of the quarter with the highest spending.

● Analysis of frequently ordered line items.

● And other relevant procurement-related inquiries.


4. Evaluation:

● Test the chatting assistant with various sample queries to ensure accuracy and
efficiency.

● Evaluate the assistant's performance in providing correct and relevant responses
